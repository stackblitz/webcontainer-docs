# Contributor Manual

We welcome contributions from folks from all skill levels and expertise. We are especially welcoming to new programmers and to those with a keen interest in growing as technical writers or DocOps engineers.

## Before you begin

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All discussions connected to our docs must be kind, respectful, and harassment-free. We will not dignify PRs or other contributions created in the spirit of disregard for the Code of Conduct.

We believe that communication is the lifeblood of any Open Source project. Please use beginner-friendly language. It's very easy to misunderstand one another in asynchronous, text-based conversations. When in doubt, assume everyone has the best intentions but consider helping them do better with clarifying questions and kind feedback. Remember that for many people English is not their first language and in such communication, native English speakers are also expected to flex their "foreigner muscle".

## Types of Contributions

There are numerous ways to contribute to docs:

- **Share feedback**
  - Each docs page features a feedback tool at the bottom - you can use it to let us know what you think!
  - If you see something broken or think any section could be better or less confusing please [check if there's an issue for that already](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-docs/issues) and if not, feel free to [create one](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-docs/issues/new).
- **Share ideas**
  - We want our docs to be delightful. If you have an idea on an improvement, reach out to us on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-docs/discussions).
- **Fix typos**
  - Use [Web Publisher](#content-updates-with-web-publisher) for a quick typo fix!
- **Create demos**
  - We'd like to help our users see more examples of using WebContainer API. Would you like to create a demo? Before you do, please reach out to us on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-docs/discussions).
- **Fix an issue**
  - You see an issue with the docs platform you'd like to work on? Ask to be assigned to fix it. Before you start your work, please read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Reviews**
  - Please feel free to check existing PRs and issues. Share your loving feedback, help the other contributor approach the task in a better way, spot lurking bugs, errors, and mistakes. You can use pr.new to that end - in the URL of the issue or PR, swap "github.com" with "pr.new" to spin up the environment and the preview.

Thank you for making our docs better!

### What makes good issue

When creating an issue, please include:

- a descriptive title,
- a link to what this issue refers to (a page, an example, a section),
- if applicable, a screenshot or screen recording,
- explanation of why you think it is an issue,
- if you have an idea, a possible solution,
- ideally, external links that explain any advanced or lesser-known topics so others can learn from your issue.

Please raise issues in situations like the following:

- confusing, overwhelming, or incorrect explanation,
- outdated examples,
- vague or missing content,
- demo or page request,
- compromised accessibility,
- anything broken: demo, page, url, image,

If what you want to say doesn't really fall into actionable "problem" or "improvement", you can **start a new Discussion topic**. For example, feel free to ask:

- Could we split this page into multiple smaller steps?
- This navigation item doesn't fit where it is - could we move it somewhere else?
- How could we make the docs site more (adjective)?
