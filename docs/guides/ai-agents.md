# Runtime Test Cases For AI Agents

To help developers validate whether WebContainer is right for their use case, we've compiled a suite of test cases that you can independently run on any runtime of your choosing (serverless, VMs, WebContainers, etc). These tests represent the most common patterns, libraries, tools, commands and environments that developers and toolchains rely on in the Node.js ecosystem, and thus serve as a good baseline for what capabilities LLM generated code would require.

## Evaluating in-browser versus server runtimes

When building AI agents you often need to execute arbitrary code. The most ideal place to do this tends to be inside the user's browser tab, as it is secure, long lived, scales infinitely, is cost effective, and boots instantly which provides an extremely fast user experience.

While creating a simple in-browser proof-of-concept is straightforward, compatibility is usually the main issue with in-browser runtimes, and this is especially the case for AI agents where you need to execute the arbitrary code LLMs produce.

Inversely, using servers (whether VMs or serverless solutions) often provide compatibility guarantees but at the expense of being short lived, expensive to scale, difficult to secure, and suffering from increased latency and cold starts.

WebContainers is the first technology that has merged the best of both these worlds by bringing the entire Node.js runtime, ecosystem and tooling into the browser with excellent compatibility â€” no servers required. To validate this, we encourage developers to run real world test cases like the ones below both in WebContainer as well as any other runtime they are evaluating.


## Test Cases
The following test cases cover a broad spectrum of essential tools and frameworks in web development, ensuring AI agents are versatile, efficient, and capable of handling *real-world* coding tasks. These tools, frameworks, and runtime features are driven by real world data observed via real world usage of over 3 million developers on StackBlitz.com every month and npm trends.

**To run these test cases**: First, download the files from the StackBlitz example and have the environment arbitrarily install the npm packages, execute the dev or start command, when applicable check the server is booted properly, and validate the results are expected.

### NodeJS 
*Multiple processes, Async promises, FS Operations, Built-ins, Http Server, Streams, Child processes, Inter, process, communication, timers, Event Emitter*

NodeJS is crucial because it evaluates the agent's ability to handle concurrency, manage child processes, and ensure performance efficiency. NodeJS's event-driven architecture makes it ideal for I/O-heavy tasks, and by leveraging multiple processes, the agent's proficiency in creating robust, performant applications is tested.

### Package managers
*NPM, Yarn, PNPM*
