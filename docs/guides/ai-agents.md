# AI Agents

AI agents in the context of writing code are designed to assist, automate, and improve the development process. These agents can perform a variety of tasks, ranging from generating code snippets to entire programs, debugging, even optimizing code, and executing code.

## Zero shot: It should just work

Ideally, AI coding agents wouldn't require any additional training of the model and would just work. This is where zero-shot capabilities come into play. With zero-shot learning, AI agents can perform new coding tasks without having been explicitly trained on them. They leverage their general understanding and previously acquired knowledge to handle tasks they haven't encountered before, making them highly flexible and efficient in a variety of coding scenarios.

To that end, the agent's code runtime should be as similar to where the end-user intends to run the code as possible. Therefore, environments like serverless, edge, or polyfills end up lacking key features that end users are looking for. Essentially, the end-user is almost always expecting to run generated code as a long running server. So what if you could have a long running server with a reliable runtime?

## Test Cases
These test cases cover a broad spectrum of essential tools and frameworks in web development, ensuring AI agents are versatile, efficient, and capable of handling *real-world* coding tasks. These tools, frameworks, and run time features are driven by real world data observed via real world usage of over 2m developers on StackBlitz.com and/or npm trends.

### NodeJS 
*Multiple processes, Async promises, FS Operations, Built-ins, Http Server, Streams, Child processes, Inter, process, communication, timers, Event Emitter*

Testing AI agents on NodeJS is crucial because it evaluates the agent's ability to handle concurrency, manage child processes, and ensure performance efficiency. NodeJS's event-driven architecture makes it ideal for I/O-heavy tasks, and by leveraging multiple processes, the AI agent's proficiency in creating robust, performant applications is tested.

### Package managers
NPM, Yarn, PNPM
