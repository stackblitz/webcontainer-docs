# Configuring Headers

This guide provides an overview on how to configure COOP/COEP headers, including hosting platform configuration.

WebContainers require that your page, even in development, is served with these two headers:

```yaml
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

These headers are needed because WebContainer _requires_ SharedArrayBuffer, which, in turn, requires your website to be cross-origin isolated.

Some browsers support a different mode for cross-origin isolation: [`credentialless`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-embedder-policy_credentialless). If you wish to serve your content in this way, set your headers instead to:
```yaml
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```
and make sure to boot your WebContainer specifying [`coep: 'credentialless'`](/api).

## Cloudflare

### All pages

You can configure headers for all pages in your `_headers` file:

```yaml
/*
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

### Specific page

You can configure headers for a specific page(`/tutorial` in this case) in your `_headers` file:

```yaml
/tutorial
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

## Netlify

### All pages

You can configure headers for all pages in your `netlify.toml` file:

```yaml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy = "require-corp"
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = "same-origin"
```

### Specific page

You can configure headers for a specific page(`/tutorial` in this case) in your `netlify.toml` file:

```yaml
[[headers]]
  for = "/tutorial"
  [headers.values]
    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy = "require-corp"
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = "same-origin"
```

## Vercel

### All pages

You can configure headers for all pages in your `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy",
          "value": "require-corp"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
          "value": "same-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Specific page

You can configure headers for a specific page(`/tutorial` in this case) in your `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/tutorial",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy",
          "value": "require-corp"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
          "value": "same-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
