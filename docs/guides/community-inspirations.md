This page is a tribute to our Community who have been using WebContainers over the past two years - and who have been building with WebContainer API since it was released in June 2022 in a private alpha. Here are some of the projects that are powered by it.

As [Manus Nijhoff](https://manusnijhoff.nl/), the author of this chess game, puts it, “If you've got nothing better to do than waste time in the terminal, Stackblitz is there with you!”

### Low-Code: Web Publisher

A publishing tool that makes editing docs or blogs pleasant thanks to a realtime preview of the changes. In fact, you can try it yourself by [editing this page](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-docs/edit/main/docs/guides/community-inspirations.md?initialPath=%2Fguides%2Fcommunity-inspirations)!
