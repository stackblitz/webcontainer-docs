Find the true size of an npm package. 

# Why?

## **For Package Users**

### Get Insights
* **Get insights:** Package dependencies can be deceivingâ€”a package with one direct dependency may actually install 100 indirect dependencies. Find out everything getting installed.

### Install Cost
* **Install cost:** The size of `node_modules` can easily get out of control. Be mindful of what you're installing and keep it in check.

### Bundle Cost
* **Bundle cost:** Importing a large dependency to your web app can easily impact its performance. It can bloat your app, slow-down load time, and increase memory usage. Optimize for ESM packages that are tree-shakeable.

### **For Package Authors**

### Install Speed
* **Install speed:** This is especially important if your package is used by CLI tools that can be loaded with [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx).

### Unideal Environments
* **Unideal environments:** Your package may be downloaded with slow internet, on slow devices, with little storage. It may even be downloaded within the browser via WebContainers.

### Security
* **Security:** Keeping dependencies to a minimum will reduce points of failure: unexpected breaking changes, malicious code, and dependency bloat.
