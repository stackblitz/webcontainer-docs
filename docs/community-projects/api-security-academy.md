The API Security Academy is a new interactive learning platform focused on mastering GraphQL security. Developed by one of [Escape](https://escape.tech)'s engineers, it's built for all levels of expertise, from a beginner to an experienced developer.

Each WebContainer contains a live GraphQL application, so learners will not only understand why a vulnerability is risky, but also how to exploit it and, most importantly, how to fix it.

And itâ€™s free, interactive, and open-source! The goal is to improve collaboration and engagement in the GraphQL community!
