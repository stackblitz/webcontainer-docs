Otto Engineer is an autonomous agent that takes AI-assisted coding to the next level.

* **Otto checks its work and iterates**: Otto executes its code and tests it to make sure it works. If there are errors, it will keep iterating until the code works ðŸ¦¾
* **Otto executes its code safely in isolation**: Otto is built on [Web Containers](https://webcontainers.io/guides/introduction), a runtime for executing Node.js and OS commands that runs entirely in the browser, with a virtual, in-memory file system ðŸ¤“
* **Otto requires zero setup**: Since it all runs in the browser, you just start a new chat and put Otto to work, watching it run commands and edit code in the embedded terminal and editor ðŸ”¥
* **Otto operates in a real environment**: Otto can install and use npm packages, tweak its TS config, and write its own tests. Say goodbye to hallucinated code that doesn't actually work ðŸ‘‹
