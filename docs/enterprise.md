## Who needs a commercial WebContainer API license? 
Licensing is required for *production* usage of the API in a commercial, for-profit setting. (Prototypes or POCs do not require a commercial license.) If you're using the API to meet the needs of your customers, prospective customers, and/or employees, you need a license to ensure compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://stackblitz.com/terms-of-service). Usage of the API in violation of these terms may result in your access being revoked.
