# Code of conduct

## Introduction

We welcome contributions from folks from all skill levels and expertise. We are especially welcoming to new programmers and to folks who have a keen interest in growing as technical writers or DocOps engineers.

We are a community that prioritizes a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to **fostering a positive environment** include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of **unacceptable behavior** by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

**We prioritize marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort.** We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'I’m not discussing this with you.'
- Someone’s refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

In community communication, we do not appreciate any form of aggression (passive aggression included) — please don't post if you can't be kind and empathetic. Be proactive about owning your mistakes and apologizing if you have a feeling or know that you impacted someone in a negative way.
